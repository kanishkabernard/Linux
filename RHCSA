3.3 ) Interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system
 
We are assuming the root password is lost , then we are trying this


**************
Change the root password when we have physcia; access and the normal behavior(rhel 9 it is different)


reboot the system
press e to edit
then go to the line linux and press ctrl+e to go to the end and press rd.break


then press ctrl+x and then it will switch to the emergency mode 


mount | grep /sysroot


Mount -o remount rw /sysroot - to change the permissions of sysroot file in mount
cd /sysroot
Chroot /sysroot
Sh#
Passwd root
then enter the new password

after that create a new file named .autorelabel
Touch /.autorelabel

exit
Reboot

then you can login with the new password




**************
Change the root password according to the RHEL 9 documentation


reboot the system 
Press e to edit
Then go the linux line and there we can see ro permission set default before the word crash, there you need to change ro -> rw 
and press ctrl e to go the end of the line and press init = /bin/bash
then press ctrl x

you’ll prompt a bash shell for the root and change the password as normally
passwd
new pasword

and then 
create the /.autorelabel file in there 
touch /.autorelabel

after that 
press exec /sbin/init
